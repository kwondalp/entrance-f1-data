# entrance-f1-data

This repository is the stable static JSON data source for ENTRANCE consumers.

It contains no API server, application runtime, or automatic publishing step. Clients fetch approved files directly, and promotion from `entrance-f1-data-tools` remains a manual, reviewed operation.

## Contents

- [data/schedule.json](data/schedule.json) — season race schedule
- [data/drivers.json](data/drivers.json) — driver roster
- [data/constructors.json](data/constructors.json) — constructor roster
- [data/driver-standings.json](data/driver-standings.json) — driver championship standings
- [data/constructor-standings.json](data/constructor-standings.json) — constructor championship standings
- [data/driver-stats.json](data/driver-stats.json) — per-driver season and career stats
- [data/race-results.json](data/race-results.json) — current-season race classifications used by app recent-form views
- [data/f1/current-grid.json](data/f1/current-grid.json) — current-grid mapping for data consumers
- [data/f1/stat-metrics.json](data/f1/stat-metrics.json) — current Stats Lab metric definitions

## Stats Lab production-ready WIP

`f1/stats-lab/v1/` is separate from the approved current-season files under `data/`. Its `manifest.json` defines the file list, sizes, SHA-256 checksums, schema version, provenance paths, unsupported metrics, and approval flags.

The current package has passed the separately authorised official-pole production-data application and is marked `production_ready` with `productionApplicationApproved: true`. It contains audited official-pole totals and recency data while preserving all unrelated public values.

Public release remains a separate gate: `approvalRequiredBeforePublish` is still `true` and `publishApproved` is still `false`. A WIP branch or commit is not evidence that the public endpoint changed.

## Historical Records publication contract

`schemas/published-historical-records.v1.schema.json` defines the future static
publication shape for approved Historical Records data. Phase 9A adds only the
schema and contract documentation; no Historical Records dataset is present or
published.

Blocked, provisional, unreviewed, canonically unapproved, or publication-
unapproved records are omitted completely. When no record is production
eligible, no placeholder dataset is created. See
`docs/PUBLISHED_HISTORICAL_RECORDS_CONTRACT.md` for the publication and
compatibility rules.

## Update safety

Current-season post-race changes must follow `POST_RACE_UPDATE_RULES.md`. Preserve all stable IDs and public shapes, validate every changed JSON file, and never infer missing Formula 1 facts from an ingestion API.
